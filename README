Asteroids! - a Java asteroids implementation in OpenGL for Dave Straayer's
			CS142 class.

Design
Since there are a limited number of students with OpenGL experience, we have
kept all the OpenGL related code in two classes ScenePanel and Sprite.  We used
two other advanced concepts that we have not yet covered in class to keep the
code uncluttered. All the game entities (asteroids, the player's ship, bullets,
etc.) implement the Actor interface, and we store all the actors currently in
the game in an ArrayList so we can have a single code path to update, render,
and handle collision detection for all entities currently in play.

Classes
	Asteroids - contains static methods for the game logic
	Vector - Provides simple 2D vectors used for position and velocity.
	GUI - Provides the GUI window.
	ScenePanel - Provides the OpenGL canvas to display the game.
	Sprite - Provides a class that uses OpenGL textures as sprites for each
			game entity. It includes a number of static methods to
			load all the required textures and provide textures for
			each type of entity.
	Actor - the interface for game entities that will move around and be
			drawn on the screen. The following classes implement
			this interface:
		Asteroid - the Asteroids in the game
		PlayerShip - the player's ship
		Bullet - a projectile shot by the player's ship.
